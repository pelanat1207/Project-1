# Project-1: MAAB-Israel

This is my first project in **Data Science course in Naya College**

This application was made in order to ease the managment of an apartments building in Israel. The main user of this application should be the building committee or a proffesional buildings' managment company. 
The main purpose of this application is to keep transparency of the expenses and the building's account stauts at all time to all apartmens' owners.

The application is made of three classes (Owner, Apartment, Building). Classes are associated to each other as explained later. Reports are available both as screen output and e-mail. 

This project is the first of five assignments required in Data Science Course of Naya College and submitted to Dror Geva.
The project demonstras the use of a multi-class application and its complexity. 

This application is setting the basis towards a more advanced house managment application, that can be further devoloped in mulitple directions, including, for example:
1. User Interface approach (instead of interactive inputs)
2. Graphical add-in for finance variables and reports
3. Pre-scheduled reports
